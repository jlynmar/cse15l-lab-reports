2) Now, we can connect remotely. To do this we click "terminal" at the top, then "new terminal", and then we type in the command "$ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu" where "zz" is replaced by the last 2 letters of the student account.
Once it's ran it should look like this:

* cd ~
* cd
* ls -lat
* ls -a
* ls <directory> where <directory> is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/cs15lwi23abc, where the abc is one of the other group membersâ€™ username
* cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt ~/
* cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt.
